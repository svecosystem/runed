Why Runed?  Svelte 5 Runes unlock immense power by providing a set of primitives that allow us to build impressive applications and libraries with ease. However, building complex applications often requires more than just the primitives provided by Svelte Runes.  Runed takes those primitives to the next level by providing:  Powerful Utilities**: A set of carefully crafted utility functions and classes that simplify   common tasks and reduce boilerplate. Collective Efforts**: We often find ourselves writing the same utility functions over and over   again. Runed aims to provide a single source of truth for these utilities, allowing the community   to contribute, test, and benefit from them. Consistency**: A consistent set of APIs and behaviors across all utilities, so you can focus on   building your projects instead of constantly learning new APIs. Reactivity First**: Powered by Svelte 5's new reactivity system, Runed utilities are designed to   handle reactive state and side effects with ease. Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support to catch errors early and provide a better developer   experience.  Ideas and Principles  Embrace the Magic of Runes  Svelte Runes are a powerful new paradigm. Runed fully embraces this concept and explores its potential. Our goal is to make working with Runes feel as natural and intuitive as possible.  Enhance, Don't Replace  Runed is not here to replace Svelte's core functionality, but to enhance and extend it. Our utilities should feel like a natural extension of Svelte, not a separate framework.  Progressive Complexity  Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible. Runed provides easy-to-use defaults while allowing for advanced customization when needed.  Open Source and Community Collaboration  Runed is an open-source, MIT licensed project that welcomes all forms of contributions from the community. Whether it's bug reports, feature requests, or code contributions, your input will help make Runed the best it can be."},{"title":"activeElement","href":"/docs/utilities/active-element","description":"Track and access the currently focused DOM element","content":" import Demo from '$lib/components/demos/active-element.svelte';   activeElement provides reactive access to the currently focused DOM element in your application, similar to document.activeElement but with reactive updates.

It centralizes the definition of every possible state and the events that might trigger a transition from one state to another. Here is a state machine describing a simple toggle switch:  import { FiniteStateMachine } from \"runed\"; type MyStates = \"on\" | \"off\"; type MyEvents = \"toggle\";  const f = new FiniteStateMachine(\"off\", {  off: {   toggle: \"on\"  },  on: {   toggle: \"off\"  } });  The first argument to the FiniteStateMachine constructor is the initial state. The second argument is an object with one key for each state. Each state then describes which events are valid for that state, and which state that event should lead to.  In the above example of a simple switch, there are two states (on and off). The toggle event in either state leads to the other state.  You send events to the FSM using f.send. To send the toggle event, invoke f.send('toggle').  Actions  Maybe you want fancier logic for an event handler, or you want to conditionally transition into another state. Instead of strings, you can use actions.  An action is a function that returns a state. An action can receive parameters, and it can use those parameters to dynamically choose which state should come next. It can also prevent a state transition by returning nothing.  type MyStates = \"on\" | \"off\" | \"cooldown\";  const f = new FiniteStateMachine(\"off\", {  off: {   toggle: () => {    if (isTuesday) {     // Switch can only turn on during Tuesdays     return \"on\";    }    // All other days, nothing is returned and state is unchanged.   }  },  on: {   toggle: (heldMillis: number) => {    // You can also dynamically return the next state!    // Only turn off if switch is depressed for 3 seconds    if (heldMillis > 3000) {     return \"off\";    }   }  } });  Lifecycle methods  You can define special handlers that are invoked whenever a state is entered or exited:  const f = new FiniteStateMachine('off', {  off: {   toggle: 'on'   _enter: (meta) => { console.log('switch is off') }   _exit: (meta) => { console.log('switch is no longer off') }  },  on: {   toggle: 'off'   _enter: (meta) => { console.log('switch is on') }   _exit: (meta) => { console.log('switch is no longer on') }  } });  The lifecycle methods are invoked with a metadata object containing some useful information:  from: the name of the event that is being exited to: the name of the event that is being entered event: the name of the event which has triggered the transition args: (optional) you may pass additional metadata when invoking an action with   f.send('theAction', additional, params, as, args)  The _enter handler for the initial state is called upon creation of the FSM. It is invoked with both the from and event fields set to null.  Wildcard handlers  There is one special state used as a fallback: *. If you have the fallback state, and you attempt to send() an event that is not handled by the current state, then it will try to find a handler for that event on the * state before discarding the event:  const f = new FiniteStateMachine('off', {  off: {   toggle: 'on'  },  on: {   toggle: 'off'  }  '*': {   emergency: 'off'  } });  // will always result in the switch turning off. f.send('emergency');  Debouncing  Frequently, you want to transition to another state after some time has elapsed. To do this, use the debounce method:  f.send(\"toggle\"); // turn on immediately f.debounce(5000, \"toggle\"); // turn off in 5000 milliseconds  If you re-invoke debounce with the same event, it will cancel the existing timer and start the countdown over:  // schedule a toggle in five seconds f.debounce(5000, \"toggle\"); // ... less than 5000ms elapses ... f.debounce(5000, \"toggle\"); // The second call cancels the original timer, and starts a new one  You can also use debounce in both actions and lifecycle methods. In both of the following examples, the lightswitch will turn itself off five seconds after it was turned on:  const f = new FiniteStateMachine(\"off\", {  off: {   toggle: () => {    f.debounce(5000, \"toggle\");    return \"on\";   }  },  on: {   toggle: \"off\"  } });  const f = new FiniteStateMachine(\"off\", {  off: {   toggle: \"on\"  },  on: {   toggle: \"off\",   _enter: () => {    f.debounce(5000, \"toggle\");   }  } });  Notes  FiniteStateMachine is a loving rewrite of $2.  FSMs are ideal for representing many different kinds of systems and interaction patterns. FiniteStateMachine is an intentionally minimalistic implementation. If you're looking for a more powerful FSM library, $2 is an excellent library with more features&thinsp;—&thinsp;and a steeper learning curve."},{"title":"IsFocusWithin","href":"/docs/utilities/is-focus-within","description":"A utility that tracks whether any descendant element has focus within a specified container element.","content":" import Demo from '$lib/components/demos/is-focus-within.svelte';   IsFocusWithin reactively tracks focus state within a container element, updating automatically when focus changes.

Example: Tracking Clicks on the Document  // ClickLogger.ts import { useEventListener } from \"runed\";  export class ClickLogger {  #clicks = $state(0);   constructor() {   useEventListener(    () => document.body,    \"click\",    () => this.#clicks++   );  }   get clicks() {   return this.#clicks;  } }  This ClickLogger class tracks the number of clicks on the document body using the useEventListener function. Each time a click occurs, the internal counter increments.  Svelte Component Usage    import { ClickLogger } from \"./ClickLogger.ts\";   const logger = new ClickLogger();     You've clicked the document {logger.clicks}  {logger.clicks === 1 ? \"time\" : \"times\"}   In the component above, we create an instance of the ClickLogger class to monitor clicks on the document. The displayed text updates dynamically based on the recorded click count.  Key Points  Automatic Cleanup:** The event listener is removed automatically when the component is destroyed   or when the element reference changes. Lazy Initialization:** The target element can be defined using a function, enabling flexible and   dynamic behavior. Convenient for Global Listeners:** Ideal for scenarios where attaching event listeners directly   to the DOM elements is cumbersome or impractical."},{"title":"useGeolocation","href":"/docs/utilities/use-geolocation","description":"Reactive access to the browser's Geolocation API.","content":" import Demo from '$lib/components/demos/use-geolocation.svelte';   useGeolocation is a reactive wrapper around the browser's $2.
