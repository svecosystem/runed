</script>

`activeElement` provides reactive access to the currently focused DOM element in your application,
similar to `document.activeElement` but with reactive updates.

- Updates synchronously with DOM focus changes
- Returns `null` when no element is focused
- Safe to use with SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- Lightweight alternative to manual focus tracking
